# Anime.js Feature Showcase

A dynamic, single-page web application designed as a comprehensive demonstration of the powerful features of the `anime.js` JavaScript animation library. This project serves as a practical reference and a portfolio piece showcasing modern front-end animation techniques.

The entire showcase is intentionally built within a single, heavily commented HTML file to serve as a clear and accessible learning tool.

### ‚ú® Features Demonstrated

This showcase provides live, interactive examples of the following `anime.js` core concepts:

*   **Hero Text Animation:** A flashy intro that uses staggering on individual letters to create a professional title reveal.
*   **Basic Properties:** Looping animations that manipulate fundamental CSS properties like `translateX`, `scale`, `rotate`, and `backgroundColor`.
*   **Advanced Staggering:** A dynamic grid animation that radiates from the center outwards, demonstrating the powerful staggering system for creating complex visual effects on multiple elements.
*   **Timelines:** A clear example of how to chain multiple animations together to create complex, sequential routines that run in a perfect loop.
*   **SVG Line Drawing:** The classic "motion graphics" effect where an SVG path appears to draw itself by animating its `strokeDashoffset` property.
*   **Playback Controls:** An interactive demo showing how to programmatically `play`, `pause`, and `restart` an animation instance using event listeners.
